fetch-modify consistency could be broke by a malicious server, but fork consistency would still be maintained. Because all updates are eventually seen by replicas, although some replicas do not perform fetch operations before modification.


The order of magnitude difference might be due to some different reasons. For example, not all client requests might need a in-memory lookup such as if a client is currently holding permission of access in memory, it would not need to perform a in-memory lookup again for the access. 
Another reason is that not all of the request are sent one by one. Multiple requests could be sent at once.
