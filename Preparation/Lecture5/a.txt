Q: Suppose we have the scenario shown in the Raft paper's Figure 7: a cluster of seven servers, with the log contents shown. 
The first server crashes (the one at the top of the figure), and cannot be contacted. A leader election ensues. 
For each of the servers marked (a), (d), and (f), could that server be elected? 
If yes, which servers would vote for it? If no, what specific Raft mechanism(s) would prevent it from being elected?

A: 
By the policy that the leader's term needs to be at least as large as the follower's term, only d will be able to elected.
(a) would get 3 votes from (a), (b), (e) which in this case doesn't meet majority requirement.
(d) can potentially get votes from all followers.
(f) would have no other votes than itself.
