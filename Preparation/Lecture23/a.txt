Similar to Raft, the GroveKV system also follows the Primary Backup architecture.

Based on the paper, upon receiving an operation, the primary executes it locally, and then replicates it to all backup servers before considering it committed and sending a reply to the client, as shown in Figure 2.

Also, paper mentioned that it GroveKV requres primary to replicate the operation to all backups before replying to the client.

This safely avoided the situation mentioned in the question, since the Put("x", "10") operation will already be blocked. Then no linearizability violation will happen if client decide to do a read on X.
