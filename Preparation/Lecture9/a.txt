Given only the context that two client issue get() requests for the same key at the same time, the same time is sort of vague discription. Even when requests submitted really close in time, there could still be a fraction of time in between. In addition, after the request there might be network delays that cause the request to arrive at the system in different times. If somehow within the "sametime" described, there's another client send a put() request with the same key, then indeed the earlier two client could get different response.
